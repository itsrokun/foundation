### **FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

*   **If you have the book in the images (751 Pages):** You have a solid foundation for theory and older questions, but you are **blind to the 2024 question patterns**, specifically for **Gas Companies (Petrobangla/Titas)**, **PGCB**, and **RAJUK**.
*   **If you are preparing for a 2025 exam:** You **need the newer edition (846 Pages)** because the question patterns for Titas Gas and RAJUK shifted significantly in 2024, and those papers are only in the new book.







Perfect! I can now **combine your previous analyses with this line-by-line Dataset A vs Dataset B comparison** to create a **fully integrated, comprehensive comparison of the FOUNDATION book**, highlighting **all differences, updates, and missing content**. Here's the detailed report:
