### **FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

*   **If you have the book in the images (751 Pages):** You have a solid foundation for theory and older questions, but you are **blind to the 2024 question patterns**, specifically for **Gas Companies (Petrobangla/Titas)**, **PGCB**, and **RAJUK**.
*   **If you are preparing for a 2025 exam:** You **need the newer edition (846 Pages)** because the question patterns for Titas Gas and RAJUK shifted significantly in 2024, and those papers are only in the new book.
